# Iris Prediction Web App

An example of how you could deploy an ML model using Plotly Dash. I am using
the iris data set with the goal of demonstrating the deployment of a web
application on an ML project output, instead of the model building itself.

## Set up and run
git clone https://github.com/robypoteau/dash-app-iris-ml.git

cd dash-app-iris-ml

make env

make run


Steps involved
1. Building a dash app
2. Setting up the app so it ran inside a Flask website
3. TODO Set up a cloud instance to share the application
